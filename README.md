# DataXKinesso

Welcome to the KinessoX Github. Here you'll find all of our team files.

All of our EDA and primary visualizations were done in IPython Notebooks. There is a description of each notebook below. The final deliverable of our tool is in a Streamlit app.

## Chi_square_exploration_V2_draft.ipynb
- Exploration of data using the chi squared metric
- Exploration of different chi squared methods and formats to determine the best one for our product


## Correlation_matrix_V2.ipynb
- The code for our V2 Demo
- EDA
- Methods for binning data and one hot encoding data
- Methods to create a correlation matrix out of clean data

## EDA_basic_bar_graphs_cleaning_for_V1_Demo.ipynb
- EDA in preperation for V1 Demo
- Creation of several bar charts and other graphs, which were refined and used in the V1 demo

## EDA_Cond_Entropy_draft_V1_Demo.ipynb
- Exploration of conditional entropy within data
- Refinement of contitional entropy methods for use in V1 Demo

## Generate_Bar_Charts.ipynb
- Methond generates set of bar charts displaying change in chosen demographic after slicing dataset
- Also displays chi squared statistic with each graph

## V1_Demo.ipynb
- Code and write up used in V1 Demp
- Contains discussion and exploration of persona
- Bar charts and contitional entropy help audience get familiar with data
